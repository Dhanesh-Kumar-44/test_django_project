What I Accomplished:

I developed two APIs using Django, one for handling CSV data and another for registration forms. Additionally, I set up Docker for initialization and ensured the code was pushed to Git for collaboration and version control.

Steps to Execute the Code:

Begin by running the Docker container using the following command: docker-compose up --build.
Navigate to this URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/csv_data/csv/.
If you wish to add new records to the database, open the '../csv_django_project/employ2.csv' file, append the new records, and then revisit the aforementioned URL.
Proceed to this URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/csv_data/register/. Here, you can complete the registration form and validate the entries. Upon successful validation, a new record will be created in the database.
